# Custom Italian Keyboard Layout

This is a custom Italian keyboard layout for Windows. It is based on the Italian keyboard layout provided out of the box, but it adds two of the keyboard shortcuts from Fedora:

- `AltGr + '` to type `` ` ``
- `AltGr + Ã¬` to type `~`

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the `setup` file

## Add a new shortcut

To add a new shortcut you need to download Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) and follow the instructions.

To run the program Microsoft .NET Framework must be installed, check the version during the installation.

Once the program is installed, open the program, click on `File` and then `Load Source File` and select the `MyITALayoutToCode.klc` file or create a new one from the basic Italian Layout.
